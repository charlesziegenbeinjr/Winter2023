# Comparing Monolingual and Bilingual Brains via fMRI
- Determine whether there is a neural signature for being bilingual
- Testing on early-exposed spanish/english speakers, english monolinguals
    - Does this introduce any bias? What of the early exposed highly proficient
- Syntactic sentence judgement task, so it is a block task?
- What about comparing it to spanish speakers only?

## Introduction
- Question whether bilingual brains process language differently than monolingual, classical research has been done on bilingual based on exposure times, language switching in bilinguals
- How do you quantify early exposure? Is this when the start learning?
- Interesting question of whether they have a fused language representation system, or whether or not they are separated
- Differences already: can process concrete words faster, fused model vs parallel models depending on age of exposure
- Hard to determine what kind of linguistic system is used
- Introduction is incredibly long, is this a good practice in general?
- What constitutes early exposure? They state that first bilingual experience is before age 5, but what does that really mean?
- Is there a control group?
- Lack of a monolingual spanish group definitely hurts this paper's findings
- Use subject-object and object-subjec, due to fact that it has been studied in the past and provides consistent results with english monolinguals
    - What impact does the data set have with bilinguals?
- English monolinguals show increased neural involvement and decrease in speed/accuracy during complex SO vs. less complex OS stimuli

## Methods
- What does handiness have to do with anything? Does this induce some change that the authors didn't mention?
- Could left-handed participants see differing results?
- Larger female presence in bilingual group, range 18-22 years, same split for monolinguals range 18-26 years
- Expsoure to the bilingualism matters? Doesn't seem like there's a standard here
- What is the effectiveness of the language proficiency task
- Determining exposure seems to be subjective
- 40 sentences given while in the fMRI scanner
- Block-design for the study
- Preprocessing was completed based on the last paper's steps

## Results
- Language group has an effect, sentence type does not
- ANOVA Table shows that RT for bilinguals was different across languages
- Are we taking into account the inherent differences of the languages themselves?
    - Isn't english hard to learn?
- Mixed ANOVA utilized by the researchers in each analysis, why are they adding a factor for "between" and "within"
