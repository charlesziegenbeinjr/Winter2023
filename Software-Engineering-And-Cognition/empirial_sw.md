# Views on Internal and External Validity of Empirical Software Engineering

## Introduction
- Empirical Methods: any procedure for conducting an investigation that relies upon experimentation and systematic observation rather than theoretical speculation
- New tools for software engineering, their effectiveness needs to be evaluated
- Difference between internal and external validity?
    - Control all aspects of the experiment, or let it run in the wild
- Effectively, are we trying to measure its effectiveness in a targeted scenario, or see if something is effective in everyday life
- Generalizability vs understanding tradeoff
- Paper seeks to do a literature review of the methods in software engineering
- Differing opinions on both internal and external, no view of the drawbacks of either
- Paper itself is still subjective in a way, do they comment on these things?

## Related Work
- Empirical testing of SWE has been around for a while, different methods have been proposed
- Replication of experiments is challenging
    - Frameworks for categorizing related studies have been created
- Lots of threats to validity

## State of the Art - Literature Review
- Current status of empirical research conducted via literature review
- Selection is limited, how can this be improved?
- Majority of the papers are not replicating their experiments
- Validity discussions are not as prevalent as they should be

## Maximizing Internal or External Validity
- Static type vs dynamic type systems
    - Differences depend solely on type system due to highly controlled research experiment, but does this suggest programmers should switch?
- External validity from different tasks and what languages people prefer

### Survey Set-Up
- Different research objectives: tradeoffs between validity measurements, how to address tradeoff, role of replication
- Questions can introduce bias, can lead to different answers depending on the phrasing
- Only 94 people completed a questionnaire and the authors claim that this represents a large number of people, trend between internal vs external validity
- Strength: collect wide range of thoughts from established people in SW world
- Weakness: not enough data

### Results
- Variability in the findings, highly opinionated
- Hard to find this work meaningful, but agree that there is really no other way to determine which is better
- Highly subjective work, think the authors did a good job collecting diverse opinions
